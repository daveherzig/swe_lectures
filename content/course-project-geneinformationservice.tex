\section{Gene Information Service}
The gene information service will be a system with three components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data Loader}\\
This component loads a data file from NCBI into a database
\item \textbf{Gene Information Service}\\
This component will provide an API which could
be used by other applications to retrieve gene specific information
\item \textbf{Gene Search Web Application}
This component will provide a simple Java based Web Application
which utilizes the Gene Information Service
\end{itemize}

\section{What is a gene}
In biology, a gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the
synthesis of a gene product, either RNA or protein.\\

\section{Basic Idea}
The gene information service will provide a system to retrieve
information for a given gene.
\begin{itemize}
\item The data which is used is coming from NCBI. The raw data size
is in the area of 4GB.
\item This data will be loaded into a database (e.g. MySQL, Postgres).
This will be done by the first component, \emph{Data Loader}
\item The data will be available over a REST interface. This is
the second component. The service will be connected to the database
a will provide query functionalities for end users.
\item A end user application will be created, where potential
users could create queries and display the gene information data.
This could be a web application or also a mobile application. In this
project, we will use a web application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In each project it is important to understand the data which
is used. Download the gene information file from the NCBI ftp server:\\
\vspace{3mm}
\verb|ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene_info.gz|\\
\vspace{3mm}
Try to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How many genes does the file contain?
\item What kind of information is in the \verb|tax_id| field?
\item Which gene types do exist?
\item Which gene type is the one which appears the most?
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
