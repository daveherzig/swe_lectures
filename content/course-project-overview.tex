\section{Introduction}
A project will cover most of the topics from this course. At the end
of each chapter, there will be a set of exercises which are used to
strengthen the knowledge in software engineering. In addition, each
student will have the possibility to play around with the tools
demonstrated in this course.\\
For all the coursework, each student needs to have a computer
(Windows, OSX or Linux) with the possibility to install additional
software.

\subsection{Projects}
There are two projects available. The two projects are
developed for the following two courses:

\begin{itemize}
\item Gene Information Service (FHNW - Master Medical Informatics)
\item Raspberry Pi GPIO Web Application (FHNW - Master Automation Management)
\end{itemize}
