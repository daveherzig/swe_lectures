\section{Required Software Environment}
The main topic of this course is software engineering and how
to build high quality software systems. The complete course does
not depend on any specific platforms nor technologies.\\
To fulfill the exercises it is (of course) needed to use
some specific technologies. These technologies could be used
on any operating system (e.g. Windows, OSX, Linux). In the
following section there is an overview of these technologies and
a short description.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Java Development Kit 15\\
(https://www.oracle.com/ch-de/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

\begin{itemize}
\item Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/)
\item IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/)
\item Netbeans (https://netbeans.org/)
\end{itemize}
All of these environments have their pros and cons. Within this course, IntelliJ
will be used
\item Texteditor Atom (https://atom.io/)
